        <h1>Three of my goals in life.</h1>
        <div class="container">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-4">
              <p align = center>Goal #1</p>
              One of my goals is to hopefully get accepted in to my dream school which is MIT
              There at MIT I hope to continue pursuing learnind and I hope to continue to learn
              more about the world of engineering and how I could one day become an engineer.
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
              <p align = center>Goal #2</p>
              Another goal I have is to become a succesful engineer. I really enjoy math and technology
              which is why I want to pursue a career that invovles my strengths. I love solving problems
              and workign hard to determine the solution to a problem.
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
              <p align = center>Goal #3</p>
              Finally my last goal I have is to become financially stable. I don't want to have to worry
              about money when I am retired or older in my life. I want to live my life with ease and have
              enough to hopefully give my children good lives and their children.
